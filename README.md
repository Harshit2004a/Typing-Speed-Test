This Typing Speed Test isbuilt using Python and CustomTkinter. It allows users to measure their typing speed (WPM - Words Per Minute) and accuracy while providing different difficulty levels.

Key Features:
1. Difficulty Levels: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard sentences.
2. Real-time Timer: A 60-second countdown to test typing speed.
3. Accuracy & Mistakes Calculation: Compares typed text with the reference and calculates correctness.
4. Words & Characters Per Minute (WPM & CPM): See how fast you type.
5. Modern Dark-Themed UI: Uses CustomTkinter for a sleek look with a black background and colored heading.
6. Restart Functionality: Retake the test anytime with a new sentence.

This project is great for improving typing skills and practicing speed and accuracy in a fun way.
